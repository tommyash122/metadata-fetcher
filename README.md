- **Error Handling**: Robust error management on both the client and server sides.
- **Editable Metadata**: Edit the fetched metadata directly within the results view.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.
- **Persistent Data**: Automatically saves your session data and restores it when you revisit.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests ensure the reliability of both the front-end and back-end.
- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive UI with features like adding/removing URLs, editing metadata, and resetting data.

## 🔄 Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) 

Our project features a robust CI/CD pipeline that ensures the reliability and quality of our codebase. This pipeline automatically triggers a series of tests every time code is pushed or a pull request is created. Key features of our CI/CD setup include:

- **Client-Side Testing:** 🖥️ The pipeline includes automated tests for the client-side code, ensuring that the front-end functions as expected.
- **Server-Side Testing:** 🛠️ The pipeline also runs comprehensive tests on the server-side code, validating that the back-end services are performing correctly.
- **Automatic Execution:** 🚦 These tests are executed automatically after every push or pull request, providing immediate feedback and maintaining the integrity of the main branch.
- **Server Lifecycle Management:** 🔧 The server is intelligently started and stopped within the test environment to prevent conflicts, ensuring clean and reliable test runs.

This setup helps catch issues early in the development process, reducing bugs and improving overall stability.


## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metadata-fetcher.git`

`cd metadata-fetcher`


#### 2.Set up the Server
Navigate to the server directory and install the dependencies:
cd server
npm install

Create a .env file in the server directory and add the following environment variables:

`REACT_APP_PORT=8000`

`REACT_APP_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000`

Start the server:

`npm start`

#### 3. Set up the Client
Navigate to the client directory and install the dependencies:

`cd ../client`

`npm install`

Create a .env.local file in the client directory and add the following environment variable:

`REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000`

Start the client:

`npm start`

The application will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`, with the server listening on port `8000`.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage
